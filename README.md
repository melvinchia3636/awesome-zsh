<p align="center">Everything you need to customize your terminal.</p>

## The Problem

ZSH provides great flexibility to customize your experience on it. However, one problem that annoys me is that all the resources (plugins, themes, etc.) are decentralized, and sometimes hard to find what you want.

## The Solution

I've done numerous researches on customizing terminals and put everything I found into a single easy-to-use website.

## üìà Status

This project is still under development, new features are being added constantly. If any bugs are found, please file an issue here, and I'll resolve it ASAP.

## üí° Inspirations 

This project was inspired by Unixorn' ![Awesome ZSH Plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins), which is a repository that documents lots of great plugins, frameworks, themes, etc. that you can use to customize your terminal. But for a new comer, this might be too much for them.
