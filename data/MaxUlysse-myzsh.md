# myZSH

Check if zsh is already installed
```bash
grep zsh /etc/shells
```
If you got something like that, skip the Download and install step:
```bash
/bin/zsh  
/usr/bin/zsh
```
Download and install the Z shell
```bash
sudo apt-get install zsh
```
Set zsh as the default login shell
```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh ${USER}
```
Install antigen
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen.git ~/antigen
```
Copy my .zshrc and .alias files
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxUlysse/myzsh/master/.zshrc -o ~/.zshrc
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxUlysse/myzsh/master/.alias -o ~/.alias
```
